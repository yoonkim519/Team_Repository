	<p>HOST: This is so exciting. We’re here to take you behind the scenes of Sarah’s weekly trip to Trader Joe’s. And she has no idea. Before she arrives, let’s talk to some of the people who are helping to make this happen.

<div>Host walks up to a woman in a sun visor and a muumuu.</div>

<div>Hi there! Who will you be today?</div>

<div>MUUMUU: I’m the woman who’s going to make Sarah feel like I’m following her around for her entire visit. I’ll have nothing in my cart and will just keep turning it directly in front of hers. Then, just when she’s forgotten about me, she’ll stroll into the pasta aisle and there I’ll be, barrelling straight at her while looking at the ceiling.</div>

<div>HOST: Interesting! And you?</div>

<div>IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT JUMPSUIT: I’m the hot mom with three well-behaved kids, two of whom will be walking beside me, suggesting healthy</div>
